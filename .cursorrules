Psionic Muse Viewer is a web application for visualizing and annotating EEG data from Muse S headbands

It's built with:

- React
- Remix
- Tailwind
- ShadCN
- Postgres/Supabase

We always add storybook stories to all our UI components.
We always add Jest unit tests to all our util files.

When adding new React components, we give each their own folder, with a story and index.tsx to export them. The structure looks like this:

ðŸ“‚ ReactComponentName/
â”œâ”€â”€ ReactComponentName.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ ReactComponentName.stories.tsx
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx

Database Access Rules:

- All database operations MUST be performed from backend routes only (never from components)
- We always use the Supabase service role key for database access (never the anon key)
- Database client (db.server.ts) should only be imported in server-side code
